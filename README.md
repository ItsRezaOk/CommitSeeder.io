# Commit Seeder

This tool generates realistic, randomized GitHub commit history for a repository.

## How it works:
- User chooses the work style for each month (startup, chill, pro)
- Randomized commits are generated based on the style
- Commits are pushed to GitHub automatically

## Setup:
1. Clone this repo
2. Modify `REPO_PATH` inside `commit_seeder.py`
3. Run:

```bash
python3 commit_seeder.py
